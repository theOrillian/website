Based in Marshalltown Iowa, I am a Senior Technology Engineer for <a href="https://marshalltown.com" target="_blank">Marshalltown</a>, a mid-west tool manufacturing and distribution company.

My role at Marshalltown is to work with our Dynamics AX users to understand their business requirements and match those with the native capabilities of Dynamics AX.

I consider myself a Dynamics AX expert developer. As well, I am confident with all aspects SQLServer, including ETL and Analytics.

My professional merit boils down to the following:
- I plan, execute, measure, adapt and repeat
- pressure does not phase me
- I show up on game day prepared to win
- with a team and a whiteboard I can get any technical problem solved

I enjoy making new professional acquaintances. Reach out if you want to talk technology, business or triathlon.
